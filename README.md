# Todo App

This is my first project. A [todo application](https://21amxxx.github.io/mytodosapp/) that you can install, that fired a notification when you are offline and that you can use it without internet connection.

I will improve it more within another branch but now, all is fine.

Enjoy it ! 

## How I did it ?

I used the following technologies:

- React
- Material UI
- Service Worker

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

## License
It's free to use, modify and distribute. Just give me the credits. Thanks !
